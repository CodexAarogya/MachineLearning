# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Earthquake Dataset

## Data Quality Checks
- Inspected missing values in key attributes such as magnitude and depth
- Removed duplicate records and non-earthquake events (e.g., explosions)
- Verified consistency of units and time range coverage

## Magnitude Analysis
- Observed that most earthquakes are low-magnitude events
- Identified that high-magnitude earthquakes are rare
- Confirmed magnitude follows a power-law distribution (Gutenberg–Richter law)

## Depth Analysis
- Found that the majority of earthquakes occur at shallow depths (< 70 km)
- Deep-focus earthquakes are less frequent and geographically constrained
- Larger earthquakes tend to occur at shallow to intermediate depths

## Temporal Analysis
- Earthquakes occur uniformly across hours and months
- No strong seasonal or diurnal patterns detected
- Long-term increase in event counts likely due to improved detection systems

## Spatial Analysis
- Earthquakes are spatially clustered rather than randomly distributed
- High activity observed along tectonic plate boundaries
- Regional variation exists in both frequency and magnitude of events

## Relationship Analysis
- Inverse relationship between magnitude and frequency observed
- Earthquake frequency decreases with increasing depth
- Aftershock sequences commonly follow major seismic events

## Outlier and Anomaly Detection
- Identified rare extreme-magnitude events with high impact potential
- Detected anomalies possibly related to induced seismicity or data errors

## Key Insights
- Earthquake occurrence is strongly controlled by geological structures
- Depth and magnitude are critical indicators for seismic risk assessment
- Observed patterns align with established tectonic and seismological theories
